# Build instructions for userver's own samples, tests and benchmarks

@warning if you are new to userver please start with @ref quick_start_for_beginners "quick start for beginners". This section is for opensourse userver development ONLY.

Usually there's no need to build userver itself. Refer to @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/build/build.md "Configure, Build and Install"
section to make a service from a template and build it. If there's a strong need to build the userver and run its tests, then:

1. Download and extract the latest release from https://github.com/userver-framework/userver

```bash
git clone git@github.com:userver-framework/userver.git
cd userver
```

2. Install the @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/build/dependencies.md "build dependencies"

Alternatively you could use a docker container with all the building dependencies
installed from @ref docker_with_ubuntu_22_04 "Docker".

3. Build userver:

```bash
mkdir build_debug
cd build_debug
# Adjust with flags from "Platform-specific build dependencies" section
cmake -S .. \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-16 \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-16 \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCPM_SOURCE_CACHE=~/cpm \
    -DUSERVER_BUILD_ALL_COMPONENTS=1 \
    -DUSERVER_BUILD_SAMPLES=1 \
    -DUSERVER_BUILD_TESTS=1
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
```

@see @ref cmake_options

4. Run tests via `ulimit -n 4096 && ctest -V`


If you need to edit or make your own docker image with custom configuration, read about
it at @ref scripts/docker/Readme.md.
