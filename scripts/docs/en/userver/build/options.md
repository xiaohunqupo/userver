Make sure to:

1. Enable the CMake options to build the libraries you need
2. Link against the libraries

The details vary depending on the method of building userver:

* `add_subdirectory(userver)` as used in @ref service_templates "service templates"
* @ref userver_install "userver install"
* @ref userver_cpm "CPM"
* @ref userver_conan "Conan"

## CMake options

To explicitly specialize the compiler, use the cmake options `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`.
For example, to use `clang-12` compiler, install it and add the following options to cmake Configure:

```shell
cmake ... -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-12 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-12
```

@warning Using LTO can lead to [some problems](https://github.com/userver-framework/userver/issues/242). We don't recommend using `USERVER_LTO`.

### CMake options for static linking

It is possible to build userver based services with libraries statically linked in.

@warning The support is platform dependant, as a result some libraies on some platforms may linked dynamically. Feel free to provide a PR to support your favourite platform.

Userver does not build dynamic libraries itself, but most of its dependencies do. CMake (by default) prefers dynamic libraries on Unix-like operating systems.

- Use `USERVER_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON` CMake option to prefer static libraries for all userver dependencies (ON by default for "sufficiently new" `Clang` versions).
With the option, CMake tries to find all dependencies as static libraries (and dependencies of dependencies), fallbacks to dynamic libraries when no static found.
- To link statically with `libstdc++` or `libc++`, use `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc"`.
- To force fully static binary (with statically linked `libc`), use `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-static"`. In such case, all dependencies must be provided as static libraries. Also `userver` must be build with `USERVER_DISABLE_PHDR_CACHE=ON` (without this flag, it can lead to endless memory allocation).

Some dependecies usually should be build from source for statically linked executable:
1. `Curl`. Use `USERVER_FORCE_DOWNLOAD_CURL=ON` to download and build Curl from source.
2. `cctz`, `yaml-cpp`, `fmt` often have no static libraries in their packages, so they should be build from source and installed in your host system (for instance, in `/usr/local`).
