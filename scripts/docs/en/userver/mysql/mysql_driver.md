## MySQL Driver

**Quality:** @ref QUALITY_TIERS "Golden Tier".

üêô **userver** provides access to MySQL databases servers via
components::MySQL. The uMySQL driver is asynchronous, and with it one can
write queries like this:

@snippet storages/tests/unittests/showcase_mysqltest.cpp  uMySQL usage sample - main page

No macros, no meta-structs, no boilerplate, just your types used directly.

### Legal note
The uMySQL driver itself contains no derivative of any portion of the underlying
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html">LGPL2.1 licensed</a>
<a href = "https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-connector-c">mariadb-connector-c</a> library.
However linking with `mariadb-connector-c` may create an executable that is
a derivative of the `mariadb-connector-c`, while `LGPL2.1` is incompatible
with `Apache 2.0` of userver. Consult your lawyers on the matter.

For the reasons above the uMySQL driver doesn't come with
`mariadb-connector-c` linked in, and it becomes your responsibility to
link with it and comply with the license.

### Features
- Connection pooling;
- Binary protocol (prepared statements);
- Transactions;
- Read-only cursors;
- Batch Inserts/Upserts (requires MariaDB 10.2.6+);
- Variadic template statements parameters passing;
- Statement result extraction into C++ types;
- Mapping C++ types to native MySQL types;
- Userver-specific types: Decimal64, Json;
- Nullable for all supported types (via std::optional<T>);
- Type safety validation for results extraction, signed vs unsigned
validation, nullable vs not-nullable validation;
- Seamless integration with userver infrastructure: configuring, logging,
metrics etc.;

### Planned Enhancements
- TLS/SSL - not implemented yet, soon to come;
- Automatic primary discovery - not implemented yet,
might be implemented soon;
- Compression - not implemented yet, may be implemented;
- More fine grained configurations - including dynamic configs and exposure
of wider spectrum of static settings - likely to be implemented soon

### Runtime Requirements
Recommended version of libmariadb3 to link against is 3.3.4 or above,
because there exists a very nasty bug prior to 3.3.4: <a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/projects/CONC/issues/CONC-622">CONC-622</a>.<br>
By default the driver will abort execution if put in situation leading to
<a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/projects/CONC/issues/CONC-622">CONC-622</a>,
since there's no generally acceptable way to resolve it: <br>
either leak memory or straight invoke double free.<br>
However, if one is unable to bump libmariadb3 version to 3.3.4 or above and
leaking in some hopefully rare cases is acceptable, <br>cmake variable
`USERVER_MYSQL_ALLOW_BUGGY_LIBMARIADB` could be set to force the driver
to leak memory instead of aborting in such cases.
