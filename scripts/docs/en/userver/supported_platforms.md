## Helper services and templates

The [userver-framework](https://github.com/userver-framework/) github
organization page contains multiple repositories, including:

* [userver](https://github.com/userver-framework/userver) - the C++
  Asynchronous Framework.
* [service_template](https://github.com/userver-framework/service_template) -
  template of a C++ service that uses userver framework with ready-to-user
  build, test and CI scripts. 
* [pg_service_template](https://github.com/userver-framework/pg_service_template) -
  template of a C++ service that uses userver framework with ready-to-user PostgreSQL database,
  build, test and CI scripts. 
* [pg_grpc_service_template](https://github.com/userver-framework/pg_grpc_service_template) -
  template of a C++ service that uses userver framework with ready-to-user PostgreSQL database, gRPC server,
  build, test and CI scripts. 
* [uservice-dynconf](https://github.com/userver-framework/uservice-dynconf) -
  the service to control dynamic configs of the other userver-based services.

All the repositories are part of the userver framework,
thus they support the same set of architectures, compilers, operating systems
and C++ standards.
