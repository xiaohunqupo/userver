## S3 API

**Quality:** @ref QUALITY_TIERS "Silver Tier".

## Introduction

üêô **userver** provides client to any endpoint that implements client to any S3
   endpoints. It uses ```namespace s3api```

The client is currently not feature-complete and exposes only some of the possible
methods, parameters and settings. The client also suffers from some
weird design decisions, like explicit selection of "http://" vs "https://". We
intend to gradually improve its quality in consequent releases.
